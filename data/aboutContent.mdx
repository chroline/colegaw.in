Turning designs and concepts into reality is fascinating to me and powers my drive to create. Each time I see my
***passion and dedication*** reflected in the results of a project that I’ve poured so much hard work into, it inspires
me to continue to go above and beyond.

Ever since I first got my hands on a computer, I was hooked. Playing Flash games on the family HP desktop opened my
eyes to a world of possibilities where you can display things—*anything*—on a computer screen. [My first foray into
website development](https://cfjn.weebly.com) led me down a rabbit hole of curiosity and learning, eventually resulting
me discovering HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery, and my interest only blossomed from there. **Little did I know that the baby
steps I took yesterday would lead me to developing the passion for software development and design that I have today.**
