As a researcher with the [**USC Information Sciences Institute**](https://isi.edu), Iâ€™m interested in exploring the
_intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence_. I study LLMs' abstract reasoning capabilities through
the lens of **graph theory**, **linguistics**, and **cognitive psychology**.

I also post articles on a Substack publication, [**The Perceptron**](https://colegawin.substack.com), where I write on
_cognition, computation, perception, and intelligence_.
